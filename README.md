## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - pandas
  - matplotlib

## Usage
### Temporal Analysis
- **Description:** This script performs temporal analysis on the dataset, including plotting the number of terrorist incidents over time and the number of incidents by attack type over time.

### Geographic Visualization
- **Description:** This script visualizes geographic data, such as countries with specific attack types as the highest occurrence and countries with unusual attack types compared to the global average.

### Dominant Attack Types
- **Description:** These scripts identify countries where specific attack types (bombing/explosion, armed assault, facility/infrastructure attack) are the most dominant.

### Target Type and Motive Analysis
- **Description:** This script analyzes the most frequent motives associated with each target type of terrorist incidents.

To use these scripts:
1. Open the Jupyter notebook containing the code.
2. Execute the cells containing the respective analysis scripts.
