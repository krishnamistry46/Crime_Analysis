Summary Analysis

The goal was to identify countries and regions that have the highest and lowest number of terrorist incidents from our dataset which recorded terrorism data from 1970 to 2017. 
From the dataset our team took reference from, it indicates the following:

1.	The country with the highest number of terrorist attacks is Iraq
2.	The country with the lowest number of terrorist attacks is Antigua and Barbuda
3.	The regions with the highest number of terrorist attacks are the Middle East and North Africa
4.	The regions with the lowest number of terrorist attacks are Australasia and Oceania

From the analysis of narrowing down the countries and regions that display high/low terrorism rates, a huge portion of terrorism events occur in developing/third world nations. Iraq shows just under 25,000 terrorist incidents from 1970 to 2017. A lot of key events revolving around terrorism unfortunately comes from Iraq. The data implies that terrorism incidents are evident in regions that have developing or third world infrastructure. It can be due to various social and political reasons. 

In the regions of both the Middle East and North Africa, it shows that from 1970 to 2017, the number of terrorist incidents come up to just under 50,000. In the second chart, the data indicate the different attack types recorded from those incidents. It is evidently shown that a huge portion of those incidents revolve around bombing and explosions. The reason for both regions having this abundant record of attacks is due to most notorious terrorism groups known globally over the years are in both these regions. Also, the reason for these attacks can vary from various social and political reasons.
