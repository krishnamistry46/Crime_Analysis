# Crime Analysis
Crime analysis Project 1 - Terrorism around the world

## Objective 3:

Are there identifiable patterns or common characteristics in countries that would contribute to the rate of terrorism?

For the characteristics of a country, we could look at various angles:

- region (or hemisphere)
- population of country
- how many tourists
- receipts of country (tourism income)

Since our database did not contain population data, and we were restricted on time, I had to abandon that avenue.

Ultimately, I decided to look at how many tourists a country gets, and compare it to the incidents of terrorism in that country, to see if there was any correlation between these two.

## Analysis:

The goal was to identify countries and regions that have the highest and lowest number of tourists from our dataset on tourism from 2022, and then compare this data to the incidents of terrorism from the years 1970 to 2017. The following is the summary of findings:
- The country with the highest number of tourists is France at 117.1 million tourists.
- The country with the lowest number of tourists is Moldova at less than a million tourists (0.0 million).
- The countries with the highest tourism seem to vary, but generally, can be located in North America or Western Europe. Conversely, the countries with the lowest tourism are typically from Eastern Europe and the Middle East.
- Looking at the correlation between the number of tourists a country gets, and the number of incidents of terrorism a country gets, there was a correlation coefficient of 0.28.
- This indicates a weak, but positive, correlation. There is somewhat of a link between the two, but it is not a strong relationship.
- In broad terms, this means there is little evidence that the more tourists a country has, the more likely it will be a target of terrorism.

The implications of such findings are as follows:

- While this analysis is far from all-encompassing on a topic as complex and multi-faceted as Terrorism, it does help provide some insight on the behaviours around terrorism. These findings indicate that terrorists do not appear to specifically target tourists, but further research would be needed to definitively conclude which variables terrorists do target.
- Comparing the data on which regions have the highest terrorism rates to which countries are most visited by tourists, you can see tourists generally stay clear of regions with high terrorism (the Middle East, South Asia), as well as regions with significantly less terrorism (Eastern Europe), but, paradoxically, continue to travel to regions with some terrorism (Western Europe). The motives behind this pattern is unclear without further research, but is interesting to note.

In conclusion, while more information is needed to make a firm conclusion on the relationship between Terrorism and Tourism, it does appear that, using tourism as one characteristic of a country, there does not seem to be a strong relationship between the two. The characteristics of a country can be defined in many ways, however, and thus, more research would be needed to conclude if further links exist.
